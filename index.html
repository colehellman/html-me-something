                    <p>A friend's suggestion to get involved with Launchcode helped me discover I have a passion for programming.  Before I joined Launchcode I had no idea what I wanted to do with my professional career.  I knew I loved technology, &amp; I wanted it to be a big part of my job.  Launchcode showed me how to accomplish this goal.</p>
                    <p>Launchcode provides many learning opportunities.  I have taken multiple classes from Launchcode.  There also groups to participate in once you class is over with.  My ultimate goal with Launchcode is to get a web developer job through their mentorship program.  Here are the programs I have done through Launchcode:

                    <p>I am very grateful for Launchcode, &amp; the opportunities it has afforded me.  Without Launchcode, I would most likely still have no idea what I wanted to do for a career.  Launchcode has helped give me direction &amp; a tangible goal.  I will continue my learning journey with Launchcode.  I recommend anyone with an interest in coding to see what they have to offer.
